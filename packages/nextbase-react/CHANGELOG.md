# @nextbasejs/react

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 3df2d46: File uploads for `file` fields: send files with a record as form data, or, with storage in an S3-compatible bucket (the new `storage.s3` option), straight to the bucket for large files, which the SDK does automatically above 4 MB. Types are checked from the file's bytes, names are generated, and files are deleted with their record, field or collection. Download with `nb.files.getUrl()`; protected fields follow the view rule, with `nb.files.getToken()` for links.
  
  **Breaking:** NextBase now needs Node.js 22 or later, as Node.js 20 reached end of life.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ccbf0ea: The server package is now `@nextbasejs/core`, replacing `nextbasejs`, so every package lives under the `@nextbasejs` scope. Install `@nextbasejs/core` and import `NextBase` from it; `@nextbasejs/next` now takes it as its peer dependency.
- Updated dependencies [ccbf0ea]
  - @nextbasejs/client@0.1.1

## 0.1.0
